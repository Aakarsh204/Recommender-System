# Overview
A hybrid recommendation system that combines content-based and collaborative filtering approaches to provide personalized product recommendations. The system analyzes product details, user ratings, and review data to suggest relevant items to users.
## Features
- Content-based filtering using product details and reviews
- Collaborative filtering using user-item interactions
- Hybrid recommendation approach combining both methods
- Extensive data preprocessing and cleaning
- Detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Performance evaluation metrics
- Interactive Dashboard with streamlit to generate recommendations based on user-id

## Dataset
The system uses an Amazon Sales Dataset with the following key features:
- Product information (ID, name, category, price [actual and discounted])
- User reviews and ratings
- Product descriptions
- Category hierarchies

# Usage
### Step 1
You can clone this repository locally using CLI or download it as a zip file.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aakarsh204/Recommender-System.git
```
### Step 2
Now, you need to create an Anaconda environment:
- First, ensure you have Anaconda downloaded and setup on your computer.
- Next, open Anaconda prompt, and navigate to the folder `Recommender-System`.
- Create an Anaconda environment using the command below.
```bash
conda create --name Recommender-System
```
This will create an environment with name Recommender-System.
### Step 3
Activate the environment for further commands
```bash
conda activate Recommender-System
```
Now setup the dependencies for the project
```bash
conda env update --file environment.yml
```
This should install and setup all the dependencies.

### Step 4
After they have finished installation, download the Collaborative Filter Model and Content Based Similarity Matrix from the links below

[Link to Cosine Matrix](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p0amjkWk1sLZMDGaWbb-e4X8jxUZIFjL/view?usp=drive_link)

[Link to CF Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HbEL57Lw5DL3Ug-gckgjqvllQutZZSWP/view?usp=drive_link)

Extract the models to the main working directory.

So far, your working directory should look like this:

```
Recommender-System
 |
 +-- cfmodel.pkl
 |    
 +-- cosine_matrix.npz
 |    
 +-- amazon.csv
 |    
 +-- environment.yml
 |    
 +-- app.py
 |
 +-- recommender_model.py
 |
 +-- preprocess.py         
```
### Step 5
Now inside the conda environment, run this command
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
This should start up the streamlit app in your local browser.
Happy Shopping!

# Technical Details

## Dependencies
```python
python
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scipy
scikit-learn
nltk
surprise
streamlit
plotly
conda
```

## Data Preprocessing
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Handling missing values
- Price formatting
- Category hierarchy splitting
- Rating weight calculation
- Label encoding for user and product IDs

## Recommendation Approaches

### Content-Based Filtering
- Used TF-IDF vectorization for product details
- Computed cosine similarity between products
- Recommended products based on item-item similarity

### Collaborative Filtering
- Implemented SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)
- Used the Surprise library for model training
- Cross-validation for model evaluation

### Hybrid System
- Combines content-based and collaborative filtering scores
- Weighted recommendation scores
- Configurable weights for each approach

## Performance Metrics
- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Average Precision Score

# Challenges
- The dataset had a unique format, where each product had comma separated user values.
- Splitting the user values often led to many predictions being the same item, but from different users.
- Going from experimenting in Colab to modularizing the code.
- Debugging the errors in the streamlit dashboard.
